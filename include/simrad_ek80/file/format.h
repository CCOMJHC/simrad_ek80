///         Vessel coordinate system (from EK80 Reference Manual)
///
///         The X-axis is the longitudinal direction of the vessel, and in
///         parallel with the deck. A positive value for X means that a sensor
///         or a reference point is located ahead of the reference point (origin).
///
///         The Y-axis is the transverse direction of the vessel, and in parallel
///         with the deck. A positive value for Y means that a sensor or a reference
///         point is located on the starboard side of the reference point (origin).
///
///         The Z-axis is vertical, and in parallel with the mast. A positive value
///         for Z means that a sensor or a new reference point is located under the
///         reference point (origin).
///
///         The vessel coordinate system follows the right-hand rule.
///
///         The rotation angle is defined to be positive for a rotation that is
///         clockwise when viewed by an observer looking along the rotation axis
///         from the origin of the coordinate system
///
///         X-axis
///         This is the main axis in the vesselâ€™s forward (alongship) direction. Positive
///         values are forward relative to the origin. Positive rotation angle is starboard
///         side down.
///
///         Y-axis
///         This is the transverse (athwartships) direction. Positive values are toward
///         starboard relative to the origin. Positive rotation angle is bow up.
///
///         Z-axis
///         This is the vertical direction in parallel with the mast. Positive values are down
///         relative to the origin. Positive rotation angle is bow towards starboard.
